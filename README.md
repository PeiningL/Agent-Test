- Description

  Input: Brand Factor between 0.1 and 2.9

  Algorithme:

  Run for 15 Years        
      Every Year: Increment Age   
      If Auto Renew - Maintain Breed  
      Else No Auto-Renew: 
          Affinity =  Payment_at_Purchase/Attribute_Price + (2 * Attribute_Promotions * Inertia_for_Switch)
          If Breed_C  Switch to Breed_NC if Affinity < (Social_Grade * Attribute_Brand)
          If Breed_NC Switch to Breed_C if Affinity < (Social_Grade * Attribute_Brand * Brand_Factor)

  Output: 

  Breed_C Lost (Switched to Breed_NC) 
  Breed_C Gained (Switch from Breed_NC)   
  Breed_C Regained (Switched to NC, then back to C)
